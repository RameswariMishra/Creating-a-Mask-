# Creating-a-Mask
This is a code I had written to create mask of an image that is later used for exampler based image inpainting.
You have to enter the location where your image is in your system.
After your image is uploaded by clicking your mouse you can select a portion, and click the "create Mask"
button to get your masked image.
